### Summary
Sleeping babies have the most beautiful faces in the world, they are the Angel. However, such peaceful little things can turn to be monstrous dragon when they are woken up by hunger, noise, bad dream or whatever pissed them off. If you have colleagues or friends with young babies, it's not uncommon to find them with tired faces at the other day, complaining the struglling to deal with a waken baby last night.

So it comes the (App_name). Well, it can not help you put your baby sleep quickly or ensure his/her sleep until next morning. No, no one can do that actually. What (App_name) can do is to record your baby's sleep length and quality in a long run, and based on which to give you the suggestion for your rest schedule and preparation.

There're more features in (App_name). It can:
* have the information about the baby's sleep in various ways. e.g., the total hours, the average hours per sleep or sleep times every day;
* support multiple time formats, e.g., Value / Day, Value / Month;
* predict the most likely baby's wake time in a range (Not 100% guaranteed! But more data will make it more precise).
